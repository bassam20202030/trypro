The purpose of this project explore the data on teachers recruitment at
different levels of schooling (with the exception of higher education,
such as universities) between 1437 and 1440 Hijri in Saudi Arabia. The
data is sourced from Saudi Open Data Office and you are expected to use
the provided data to answer the questions below.

Remember that this is a collaborative work and each member must
participate in completing the project.

\item
  The team leader should clone the project files from
  \url{https://github.com/musabu/DSC200_202_course_project.git} to their
  github account.
\item
  Make the repo private during the creation process.
\item
  Add the members of your team and your instructor (my username is
  musabu) as collaborators on the project.

Import the files to your rstudio cloud. The R Markdown for solving the
tasks is called saudi\_teachers.Rmd.

\hypertarget{packages}{%
\subsection{Packages}\label{packages}}

Once you import the project into rstudio.cloud, open the file
saudi\_teachers.Rmd. Ensure you have the \texttt{tidyverse} and
\texttt{readxl} packages installed by running the 2 lines of code below.
Both the team leader and members should run the code below in the
console of rstudio \texttt{install.packages("tidyverse")} and
\texttt{install.packages("readxl")}

\hypertarget{loading-libraries}{%
\subsection{Loading Libraries}\label{loading-libraries}}

Here we load the libraries that we will need to read the MS Excel file
and to manipulate the dataset. Both the team leader and members should
run the code below.

We then need to load the data from the MS Excel (.xlsx) file, named
teachers\_data.xlsx, to the R environment for processing.

\emph{Note: Only Team Leader should run the code below}

\textcolor{red}{(8 points)}

The first thing we need to do is to tidy the data by changing the Arabic
column names to English names that you could easily use in your code.
There should be no space in the column name. For example, change the
arabic text Al-Sanah to \(year\). I have provided you with some English
names you could use in the tasks below. You could use Google Translate
to find the right English words for the rest of the variables. Ensure
that there is no space for variables with two words. For instance
administrative regions should be written as administrative\_regions.

\end{Shaded}

Team Leader should \emph{Knit, commit, and push changes to GitHub with
an appropriate commit message. Make sure to commit and push all changed
files so that your Git pane is cleared up afterwards.}
